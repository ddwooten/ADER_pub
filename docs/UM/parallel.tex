ADER has been developed for threaded operation with the OpenMP interface just
as SERPENT2 has. To run ADER with more than one thread do the same thing
SERPENT2 asks, add the input seen below to the command line executing the
SERPENT2 run. This will enable threaded computation for SERPENT2 as a whole
as well, and this input does not need to be duplicated for both SERPENT2 and
ADER to run in a threaded manner - only one instance of this command line option
should be used.

\begin{lt}
-omp [num_threads]
\end{lt}

ADER is not compatible with distributed memory computing - i.e. while SERPENT2
can do MPI runs, SERPENT2 with ADER can not. The code as a whole may be
compiled in a way to run with MPI but only non-ADER simulations can be run with
MPI.
