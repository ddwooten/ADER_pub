ADER comes complete with a unit test suite and a suite of system tests.

\subsection{Unit Tests}\label{ssec:unit_tests}
To run ADER's unit tests, compile the code with the ``\texttt{-DADER\_TEST}" 
flag and run, on a single thread, the input file ``\texttt{test\_input.txt}" 
found in the ``\texttt{inputs/Test\_Input}" directory with the run option
``\texttt{-test}". The results of the unit tests will be found in the executing
directory in a file titled ``\texttt{TestResults.test}".

\subsection{System Testing}\label{sssec:system_testing}
To run any one of ADER's system tests compile the code anyway except with the
``\texttt{-DADER\_TEST}" flag. Then, with any number of threads, run any of the
system test files found in any of the system test directories found in the 
``\texttt{System\_Testing}" directory. Compare the results with the desired
results described in the README files.
