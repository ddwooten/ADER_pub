Following the solution of the material optimization problem as handled by
\texttt{ADERCorrectTransportCycle}, \texttt{BurnupCycle} will shortly call
\texttt{BurnMaterials} which will manage the burnup solution for the current 
step. \texttt{BurnMaterials} will then pass off ADER cluster parent materials
to \texttt{ADERBurnMaterials} which manages the burnup solution for ADER
clusters. Much like the composition matrices, material's which are linked
by ADER streams must have their burnup matrices solved as a whole. The burnup
matrix as produced by ADER is ill-behaved when solved with TTA methods. As such,
only the CRAM solution method is used on ADER material burnup problems. The
burnup matrix is built one column at a time with no values dropped. It is stored
as in a dense column-major format.
