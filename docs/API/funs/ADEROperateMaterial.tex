\textbf{Info}: If any one function could be considered the workhorse of ADER, 
it would be this one. This function, called from
\texttt{ADERCorrectTransportCycle} orders and executes the updating of a
cluster's composition matrix as well as the determination of the optimal
solution. Numerous components of the composition matrix require updating with
each ADER iteration. The majority of these updates are due to changing isotopic
compositions and possible changes to material densities.
The \texttt{stream\_counter} variable is necessary as ADER simulations with
only prescriptive streams will have no ``optimal" solution and as such the
solving of such a problem should be skipped. Once the various updates to the
composition matrix have been completed the solver function, 
\texttt{ADEROperateMaterialCompMatrix} is called.\\
