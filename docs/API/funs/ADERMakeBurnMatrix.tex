\textbf{Info}: This function replicates, through itself and its child-functions,
the functionality of \texttt{MakeBurnMatrix} with the addition of functionality
as needed by ADER. The burnup matrix is stored in a dense column-major format. 
Cross sections are pulled from \texttt{rea} structures which are attached to 
\texttt{nuc}s. As such, the sequence of functions \texttt{CalculateTransmuXS}
\texttt{StoreTransmuXS} must be called for each cluster member such that the
cross sections for that cluster member are used when filing in the burnup matrix
data as the two mentioned functions move the XS information from the material
\texttt{dep} structures to the \texttt{rea} structures.

\noindent \textbf{Inputs}:
\begin{itemize}
\item{struct ccsMatrix burn\_matrix}
\item{double* col\_vector}
\item{long mat}
\item{long num\_ents}
\item{long num\_rows}
\item{long step}
\item{long step\_type}
\item{double t1}
\item{double t2}
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Returns}: void
