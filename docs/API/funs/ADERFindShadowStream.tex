\textbf{Info}: Searches for a matching stream in a material that is not the
passed in material. This finds shadow streams and returns the negative index
of this stream as destination streams receive the \texttt{ptr} to their source
shadow stream as -1 * index-of-source. Source side streams receive unmodifed
\texttt{ptr}s to their destination shadow streams. 

\noindent \textbf{Inputs}:
\begin{itemize}
\item{long ader\_mat\_stream}
\item{long mat}
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Returns}: long
