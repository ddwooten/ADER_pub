\textbf{Info}: Loops through all SERPENT2 materials checking for those
material's under ADER control. First calls functions to add materials to ADER
clusters, to ensure that all cluster members have matching isotopics, to add
conditions to materials, to connect streams to materials, and to link
various \texttt{ptr}s related to isotopes and their data. Following these
functions shadow streams are processed as all materials must already have
streams to find the shadows ( see the user's manual for this term ). 
The optimization entries are added to materials and then, following a check
on some user data the material cluster composition optimization matrices are
first constructed and allocated space in another function call. Once space has
been allocated these matrices are then filled for the first time. Not thread
safe.\\
