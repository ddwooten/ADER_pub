\textbf{Info}: Called from \texttt{BurnupCycle}. Called after an initial 
transport sweep executed by \texttt{TransportCycle}. Orders the filling-in of
the material composition matrices, their solution, and the incorporation of any
instentaneous changes. Following the incorporation of such changes their
effects on reactivity are assessed with a new transport sweep. After which, if
the multiplication factor of the system is within the user bounds or if the
number of iterations have been exceeded, this function will exit.

\noindent \textbf{Inputs}:
\begin{itemize}
\item{long dep}
\item{long step}
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Returns}: void
