Test Name: 5_Test

Key Concepts/Relationships Being Tested: 
    Streams, Table-class, constant type, from the material, elemental

Target Result: Amount of H-1 should go from 0.5 in the material to ~0.4 at 
the end of the second burn step while H-2 should go from 0.25 to ~0.2. The
material density should go from 1.0 to ~0.85. The amount of U-235 should
remain approximately constant. In the next burnup step H-1 should go from ~0.4
to ~0.32 with H-2 going from ~0.2 to ~0.16 with the material density ending at
~0.73. The U-235 density should remain approximately unchanged.

Status: PASS
