Key Concepts/Relationships Being Tested: 
    Streams, Table-class, discrete type, between materials, elemental 

Target Result: Amount of H-1 should go from 0.5 in Tank1 to ~0.25 at the
end of the first burn step while H-2 should go from 0.25 to ~0.125 in Tank1 and
from 0.0 to ~0.125 in Tank2. The material density should go from 1.0 to ~0.625 
in Tank1. 
The amount of U-235 should remain approximately constant in both tanks. In Tank2
the amount of Ar-40 should remain unchanged. The amount of H-1 in Tank2 should
go from 0.0 to ~0.25. The density of Tank2 should go from 1.0 to ~1.375.

Status: PASS
