Test Name: 6_Test

Key Concepts/Relationships Being Tested: 
    Streams, Table-class, constant type, between materials, isotopic 

Target Result: Amount of H-1 should go from 0.5 in Tank1 to ~0.375 at the
end of the first burn step while H-2 should remain unchanged in both Tank1 and
Tank2. The material density should go from 1.0 to ~0.875 in Tank1. 
The amount of U-235 should remain approximately constant in both tanks. In Tank2
the amount of Ar-40 should remain unchanged. The amount of H-1 in Tank2 should
go from 0.0 to ~0.125. The density of Tank2 should go from 1.0 to ~1.125.

Status: PASS
