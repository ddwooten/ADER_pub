Test Name: 11_Test

Key Concepts/Relationships Being Tested: 
    Streams, group class, constant, from the material, non-shadow
    Groups, only elemental 
    Preservation 
    Condition table, range, value 
    Optimization, maximazation, target stream

Target Result: The amount of H-1 in the material should remain approximately
constant at 0.5. The Amount of H-2 should go from 0.0 in the material to ~0.25 
at  the end of the first burn step. The amount of U-235 should go from 0.5 to
~0.25. The
material density should remain approximately constant at 1.0. 

Status: PASS
