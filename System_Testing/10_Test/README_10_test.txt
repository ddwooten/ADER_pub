Test Name: 10_Test

Key Concepts/Relationships Being Tested: 
    Streams, group class, constant, to the material, non-shadow
    Groups, mixed isotope groups
    No preserve
    Condition table, range, bounds
    Optimization, minimization, redox streams

Target Result: Amount of H-2 should go from 0.0 in the material to ~0.5 at 
the end of the first burn step while He-4 should go from 0.0 to ~0.5. The
material density should go from 1.0 to ~2.0. The amount of H-1 and U-235 
should remain constant.

Status: PASS
